# ezWaitlist-java-spring
Business solution for restaurants with dine-in waitlists. Message for list of dependencies and for usage.
This web app was a project I started primarilty to familiarize myself with the Express framework. Utilizes
Pug/Jade templating, and Node.js for routing and db calls. Utilizes EC2 Amazon Linux + MySQL RDS.

## Further Development:
> More effective caching system to lighten load on db
> Implement UQR (or other o-source QR gen) for add/view pages
> restAPI- HTML waitlist updates for business sites (later)
